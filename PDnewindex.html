    <h2 class="highlight">Tips for a Successful Prime Day Shopping Experience</h2>
    <h3>1. Make Your Wishlist Early</h3>
    <p>Start by creating a wishlist of the items you actually need. Think about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>That hands-free breast pump you've been eyeing</li>
        <li>A baby bottle washer and sterilizer to save time and sanity</li>
        <li>Comfy, breathable pregnancy clothes</li>
        <li>Diapering supplies, feeding tools, or even self-care treats for mom.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Download the App</h3>
    <p>Download the app to make your Prime Day shopping smoother and more convenient. With the app, you can easily track deals on your wishlist, set alerts for when specific items go on sale, and receive real-time notifications for price drops and Lightning Deals.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Compare Before You Buy</h3>
    <p>Sometimes, the Prime Day deal isn't really the best deal. Compare prices across a few sellers and check product reviews, especially for baby gear. You want safe, durable items that other moms actually love.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Set a Budget and Stick to It</h3>
    <p>It's easy to get swept up in the sales. Decide what you're willing to spend ahead of time. Then, prioritize the products that matter most to your stage of motherhood.</p>
